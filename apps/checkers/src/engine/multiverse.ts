/**
 * The multiverse: many checkers boards arranged into timelines, with pieces
 * that can travel into the past.
 *
 * Rules in one breath:
 *  - A timeline is a sequence of boards, one per turn. Red moves on even
 *    turns, Black on odd turns.
 *  - On your turn you must make one move on EVERY timeline whose newest
 *    board is waiting for you. Only then does the turn pass.
 *  - A move is either a normal checkers move (jumps are mandatory), or a time
 *    travel: lift one of your pieces off the newest board and put it on the
 *    same square of a past board where it was also your move. That past
 *    board branches into a brand-new timeline.
 *  - You win the moment your opponent has no pieces left on any board, or
 *    has a board waiting for them with nothing they can do on it.
 *  - Forty moves by each side with no capture, crowning, or time travel is
 *    a draw, so two kings can't chase each other forever.
 *  - Optional "strict present" rule, borrowed from 5D Chess: you only HAVE to
 *    move on boards at the present (the earliest "now" anywhere), boards
 *    further ahead are optional, and you end your turn yourself.
