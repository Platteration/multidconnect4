# multidconnect4

Read AGENTS.md first. It holds the working rules every coding agent follows in this repository; this file adds the notes specific to this project.

Expo (React Native + TypeScript) app: a 5D-chess-style multiverse time travel
parody built on Connect Four. See README.md for the rules and layout.

- Engine lives in `src/engine` and must stay free of React/React Native imports.
- Boards are immutable; every rule function returns a new value.
- `npm test` runs the jest-expo unit tests, `npm run typecheck` runs tsc.
- Exact versioned Expo docs: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/
