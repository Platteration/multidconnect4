/**
 * The map as it is actually mounted, with the real thumbnails in it.
 * `map.test.ts` covers the arithmetic of the window and the places things are
 * put; this covers the focus - the board the screen is pointing the map at -
 * which nothing tested at all: the map could stop following it entirely with
 * the whole suite staying green.
 *
 * The sibling game's map-render test, against this app's map. The window here
 * is kept as the row and turn in the corner rather than as a band of pixels,
 * so what a stale one means is different, but the two properties are the
 * same: the focused board is mounted, and it stays mounted when the state
 * changes shape under a scroll position that no longer means anything.
 *
 * The map pulls in the thumbnails, which pull in the theme and with it the
 * storage the app keeps its settings in. None of that is under test here.
