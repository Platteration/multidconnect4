 * AsyncStorage is localStorage keyed by *origin*, and a GitHub Pages project
 * site shares its origin with every other app the account publishes — the
 * sibling game included, which stored the same bare `settings.v1` — so each
 * key carries the app's name. Records read back are untrusted: every reader
 * goes through `validate.ts`, never a bare spread.

 * — validation stays at the read boundary, and a record the app cannot parse
 * is still the player's only copy — and the old key is deleted only once the
 * write succeeded, so a full store retries next launch. Running it again is a
 * no-op: the "new present" branch is the idempotence, and there is no flag to
 * lose.
 *
 * On the web the bare key is never deleted. localStorage there is shared by
 * origin, and the bare `settings.v1` may be the sibling app's: both apps copy
 * from it and leave it. Five small orphaned keys are the cost.
